This is my configuration files for linux/ubuntu
-------------------

## VIM 

Vim is so powerful that it never fails you when you turn to it. 
My vimrc file is inspired by many wonderful online open vimrc files.
Features include:

+ highlight
+ molokai theme
+ handful pluings: nerdTree, Tagbar, etc
+ python-mode: Since I'm a python developer, this plugin gives me excellent developing experience.

## GIT
Git is awesome, flexible, and powerful. Some basic configurations can
save you a lot time at work, which includes alias, set default editor, 
username and email.

## TMUX
With tmux, you have multi shells and editor easily. I hardly use vim tabs
ever after. Think about it, you opened multi shells, and they worked simultaneously. 
What's better, you can continue your work anytime anywhere by reattaching them.
You can read tmux introduction articles [here](http://danielmiessler.com/study/tmux/)
and [here](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course).

## Others

Apt-source configed, and basic packages installed:

- git: must have
- zsh: last shell you'll ever need
- ipython: powerful python interactive shell
- curl: download the internet
- tmux: work space management
- vim: best text editor ever
- exuberant-ctags: works best with vim
